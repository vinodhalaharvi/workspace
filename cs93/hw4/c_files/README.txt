# limitations 
1) No proper memory management. Memory is allocated  but not free-d. 
Since our programs are small we don't have to worry about memory leaks for this problem set. 
This will be taken care off during problem set 5 submission.

2) There are some function that says "not implemented yet". I am not sure if I will be needing those instructions in the future ? So I have left a place holder for those functions. These will be clean up during problem set 5 submission.
