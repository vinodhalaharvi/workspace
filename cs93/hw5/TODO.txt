UI for the emulator/assembler

you ned stack pointer during emulator?
you need heap pointer during assembler?

make clean ; make runas CFLAGS+=-DDEBUG=1
make clean ; make runas

make clean ; make runem CFLAGS+=-DDISASSEMBLY=1 CFLAGS+=-DDONTEMULATE=1 # do not emulate just print as inst
make clean ; make runem CFLAGS+=-DDISASSEMBLY=1 # emulate but regular display
make clean ; make runem CFLAGS+=-DEMULATE=1 # emulate and curses display 


testing notes
#####################
check out the addi with negative values, for example addi $sp, $sp, -60 ;[0x00001A]:0x23BDFFC4
check out the issue with lb and lbu. Which one is correct ?

#ifdef DISASSEMBLY
